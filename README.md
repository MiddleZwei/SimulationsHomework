### Sine calculator
#### 09.03.18 

* Calculates sin function using Taylor Series.
* Includes optimizations:
	* calculate power of the next iteraton using the previous one,
	* calculate factorial of the next iteration using the previous one and
	* limit the radian argument to range to `[0, PI/2]`, adjust the result appropriately.
* User specifies:
	* whether their input is given in radians or degrees,
	* the argument to calculate,
	* the precision to calculate with (number of iterations).
